Another webscraper, but this time the code is styled in an OOP focused design.

## Scope, Features and Misc Notes
* Implement commander, so that this one can be used in terminal as a CLI tool
* Build with TDD
* Abstract and refactor to be as readable as possible
* Be closer to clean code best practices
